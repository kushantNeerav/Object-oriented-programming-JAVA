Packages = Java Have two types of packages:
          -> Built-in packages like scanner , file, Buffered, math
          -> User-defined = Packages that user define

  Packages in Java are a powerful way to organize your code, avoid naming conflicts,
  and control access. Think of them like folders that group related classes, interfaces, 
  and sub-packages together.



  Access-Modifier :-
  Java have four access-specifiers :-

  1.Public= it can be accessible in a class.

  2.Private= In this type only the class can access the private things not sub class, not package or not any inherit class.
             (We can use private things in java by making Getters & Setters).

  3.Protected= It can be used bysame package, another packages but not another classes.

  4.Default =when we not use any specifier than java automatically count it as default means it can be 
             accessible anywhere within the same package.

  public syntax: 
  class Ram{
        public String name;       
  }
  public class Account{
    public static void main(String...s)
    {
        Ram r=new Ram();
        r.name="SHIV";                   
    }
  }

  default syntax:
    package Bank;               =any file which uses this same name package can access this String name
    class Ram{
         String name;     =default   
  }
  public class Account{
    public static void main(String...s)
    {
        Ram r=new Ram();
        r.name="SHIV";                   
    }
  }

  Private syntax:
   class Ram{
        public string name
        private String password;   = it is private    
  }
  public class Account{
    public static void main(String...s)
    {
        Ram r=new Ram();
        r.name="SHIV";    
        r.password="ABC";      XerrorX = it gives Xerror as we cannot use password, we only access password in ram class only.              
    }
  }

  By using getters & setters we can access password:-
   class Ram{
        public String name;  
        private string password;    
          
     (   getters:-                         = it is called getters and setters
        public string getpassword
        {
            return this.password;
        } 

        setters:-
        public void setpasswrd(String pass)
        {
           this.password=password;
        }                            )
  }
  public class Account{
    public static void main(String...s)
    {
        Ram r=new Ram();
        r.name="SHIV";       
        r.setpasswrd="Kushant2004"
        System.out.println(r.getpassword());   = it gives me the pasword i want.      
    }
  }
